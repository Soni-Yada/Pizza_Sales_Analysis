This project demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow — from data ingestion and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and presentation. 
The goal is to extract meaningful business insights from raw data using Power BI, SQL Server, and Gamma App.

Objectives-

Load and explore raw datasets efficiently.

Clean, transform, and model data in Power BI.

Execute SQL queries to perform data validation, aggregation, and trend analysis.

Design an interactive Power BI dashboard for key business insights.

Present findings using Gamma for an engaging, data-driven presentation.

Tools & Technologies-

Power BI-	Data loading, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and dashboard creation
SQL Server-	Data querying, aggregation, and validation using SQL
Gamma-	Final presentation and storytelling of insights
Excel/CSV- 	Source data format before import

Project Workflow-
1. Data Loading (Power BI)

Import the dataset(s) directly into Power BI from CSV or SQL Server.

Inspect data structure and types.

Establish relationships between tables if multiple data sources are used.

2. Data Cleaning (Power BI)

Handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data using Power Query Editor.

Standardize formats (dates, text, categories).

Create calculated columns and measures (e.g., total revenue, profit margin).

Rename columns and tables for clarity.

3. Data Exploration & SQL Queries (SQL Server)

Import the same dataset into SQL Server.

Run SQL queries to validate Power BI results:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)

Joins between related tables.

Filtering and grouping for deeper analysis.

Export key query results back into Power BI if needed.

4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Design interactive visuals:

KPI cards for performance metrics.

Trend and comparison charts.

Filters and slicers for user interactivity.

Apply consistent color schemes and formatting.

Use DAX for advanced calculations.

5. Insights & Presentation (Gamma App)

Summarize findings and key insights from the Power BI dashboard.

Build a professional presentation using Gamma.

Incorporate visuals, KPIs, and recommendations for stakeholders.
